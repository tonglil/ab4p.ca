                        He was in first year and I was in fourth.
                        I had no idea how he knew who I was or what drove him to send a stranger a friend request.
                        Now fast forward three years, after I had had the pleasure of working with him as a Student Ambassador and on the Totem Football League Committee, and I think I have figured it out.

                        While some might hesitate to step forward and make an introduction, Aaron is already asking about your life story.
                        While some glance away while passing a stranger on the street, Aaron flashes a big toothy (or toothless) grin.
                        While some might hesitate to step onto the stage, Aaron is standing next to you with guitar in hand as you serenade the crowd.
                        Aaron is a connector and an engager.
                        His interests are varied and diverse, as have been his involvements.
                        He is easily one of the most balanced and well-rounded individuals I have met.

                        In my seven years at UBC, few AMS Presidents have been able to simultaneously operate the Society while engaging students on the ground.
                        Few AMS Presidents have been able to demonstrate that they, too, are students, and can be the bridge between a world-renowned education and the communities that make our university experience unforgettable.
                        As a peer, friend and former supervisor to Aaron, I am confident that he can deliver in bringing the student back into student government.
                        For these reasons, it gives me great pleasure to officially endorse Aaron Bailey for AMS President."

                        On top of that, he's a genuinely caring person who's in it for the right reasons.
