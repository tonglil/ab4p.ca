                    <p>
                        He has a strong history in the AMS and has support & experience within the system, making it actually possible for him to implement the change he wants to see.
                        After the BDS meeting we think the AMS could use some shaking up, and we think Aaron is the best person to lead that."

                        In my time knowing aaron, I have come to know him as a deeply kind and caring person with unparalleled drive, ambition, and vision.
                        He is the kind of human being who you can call crying at midnight and know he'll drop everything to show up and take care of you, and he is also the kind of human being you can trust to run a student government.
                        If his leadership experience, his passion for involvement, his knowledge of the system, and his clear-cut goals and plans aren't enough to assure you that he should be our next president, then I don't know what is.
                        Maybe his great hair.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        An important note: aaron has been coming under a lot of fire from the campus left for some of his social media actions and general ways of being, and many may see my endorsement of aaron as anti-feminist or a betrayal of my values.
                        I want to address this openly: I'm not voting for aaron solely because he is a friend of mine.
                        I trust in aaron's experiences in student government, but I also know he has worked tirelessly to understand his privilege, unlearn, and become a better feminist and human being, especially over the course of the past year.
                        He has never asked to be educated, but instead educated himself, and has always been accepting of criticism and call-outs when they arise."
