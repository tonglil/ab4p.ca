    Biography

<div id="bio">
    <p>
        The AMS President exists to be the driver of an effective student Society, a strong amplifier of the student voice, and a passionate visionary for the future of the AMS. My name is Aaron Bailey and I am running for the AMS Presidency because I believe our Society is severely lacking this type of leader and that this is hurting UBC students.
    </p>

    <p>
        As a fourth year student at UBC, I have had numerous privileges to work towards the creation of a stronger UBC Community. Some of these highlights include:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            President of the Science Undergraduate Society
        </li>
        <li>
            Senior Residence Advisor and Senior Campus Tours Ambassador
        </li>
        <li>
            UBC Student Senator
        </li>
        <li>
            Leader on campus community projects such as the UBC BikeRave and the AMS Microbrewery referendum
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        If elected, I intend to remind the AMS that it is a STUDENT government. To do this I will:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Expand Block Party by re-establishing ACF
        </li>
        <li>
            Build a more genuine culture of engagement within the Society
        </li>
        <li>
            Work to increase accessibility to student and university executives
        </li>
        <li>
            Establish a student-centred strategic plan
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
