    Dear friend,
</p>

<p>
    The AMS, in its current form, is out of touch with the demographic it exists to serve.
    Although it succeeds in providing services and opportunities to students, apathy and disengagement with our student Society have never been more prominent.
    From my experience as a student politician, I know how easy it is to collect titles, produce reports, cast votes, and continue to tell yourself that your peers share the purpose you find in student government.
    However, through countless conversations over the past four years, I've come to understand that the average individual sees the AMS much differently than its "insiders" do.
    From within the AMS, I see an organization that lends support to hundreds of campus clubs, while others see an overly bureaucratic body with frustrating financial policies and confusing channels of communication.
    When I look ahead to the possibilities of how a new Student Union Building can connect us all to campus, what is really visible are the continual delays and perceived mismanagement of funds.
    When I see hours upon hours of hard work being poured into AMS services, businesses, and events to make the lives of UBC students easier and more enjoyable, most people struggle to even identify who is behind it all.
    This list goes on and on.
</p>

<p>
    As the Ubyssey is oft to point out, AMS Presidential candidates have a history of running on vacant platforms that consist primarily of increasing "student engagement".
    It is often presumed that the Society's struggle to find relevance in the lives of UBC students can be resolved with the flip of a switch.
    Whether that switch is "providing a voice" to more students, or being more "transparent" as an organization, the crucial question of whether students want to be engaged, and what that might look like, is often neglected.
    For me, the question of engagement is a systemic one that revolves around a central tenant: as students, we actively seek memorable, positive, and most importantly, <span class="strong">fun</span> experiences during our time at university.
    For the AMS to be recognized as a source of that, we need a cultural paradigm shift away from self-serving pompousness to an organizational attitude that better reflects the community we exist to serve.
</p>

<p>
    A President has three unique opportunities to be the catalyst for such a change within an organization like the AMS:
</p>

<p>
    First and foremost, the President is responsible for setting the tone within the team.
    The attitude with which they approach developing the dynamic that guides the work of those around them will directly correlate to how well that organization operates.
    Over the past few years, that tone has been misaligned and overshadowed by a sense of inane seriousness.
    Each decision made is the most important ever, and there is no room for humour, banter, positive discourse, or fun.
    As a result, the Council chambers has become an AMS war room creating a significant barrier to engagement between elected representatives and those they are elected to represent.
    If the AMS truly wants to start shifting away from disengagement, the President needs to build a team dynamic within the Executive and Council that is outwardly focused and emphasizes the <span class="oblique">student</span> within student politics.
</p>

<p>
    Next, the President is the spokesperson for the entire student body, and is responsible for representing the views of many during key conversations, such as those with the university administration.
    Because of this responsibility, it is imperative for a President to set aside their personal beliefs or motivations to most genuinely represent the opinion of the students.
    Although the AMS Presidential office has made strides to be available on behalf of the student body when necessary, the fortitude and authenticity of these efforts has been lacklustre, especially in recent months.
    With regards to the recent fee increase proposals from the University – arguably the most visible and important issue that affected students this past year – the AMS' lobbying lacked passion or poignancy when it was needed most.
    Even when provided with a clear democratic basis for strong advocacy from the historic Annual General Meeting, the response from the AMS Executive was slow and ineffective.
    This was defended on the pretence that they feared risking diplomatic relations with UBC Central.
    Recognizing the need to maintain some semblance of professionalism in liaising with the University, the AMS still failed to demonstrate any real desire to fight on behalf of students – a responsibility that falls at the feet of the President.
    In order to restore faith in the Society among students, the President's office needs to show genuine passion regarding issues that affect the constituents of the AMS, both in public and behind closed doors.
</p>

<p>
    Lastly, and most importantly, it is the President's job to dream big.
    From their position, they have a view of the entire Society's operations, making them the ideal person to guide its future direction.
    The AMS is uniquely equipped to do things that other student organizations of its size are unable to.
    Our structure and autonomy allows us to push the envelope and create imaginative opportunities for our members.
    Initiatives like lobbying for free access to the UBC Aquatic Centre, supporting the organization of the largest student-run charitable concert in North America, and building a multi-million dollar Student Union Building complete with a rock-climbing wall and rooftop garden exemplify the AMS' history of doing amazing things for this campus.
    Recently however, the focus has been on keeping the machine oiled in order to stay afloat, and the lack of meaningful risk-taking has created disillusionment among students.
    For the AMS to truly reignite engagement, it needs to be willing to take chances, make mistakes, and get messy.
    For this to happen, a push is needed from the AMS President.
</p>

<p>
    [With elections upcoming in March, the student body will once again have the opportunity to decide who is in charge of steering the Society through the coming year and into the future.
    I urge you to read into the issues, think deeply about what you look for in your student government, and get out to vote from March 9th-13th at ams.ubc.ca/elections.]
</p>

<p>
    I thank you for taking the time to read about the realistic goals that I have set for myself and the experience that I possess, which will allow me to achieve those goals as your next AMS President.
    Together, we can sow the seed for a more engaging, more inclusive, and more fun student Society.
