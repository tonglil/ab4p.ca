<p>
    Having spent a year as a student representative of the UBC Senate, I understand the governing structure and pace with which the University approaches changes and initiatives related to academia.
    Due to the triennium structure of the Senate (most Senators serve three year terms), student representatives are at a disadvantage due to our yearly turnover.
</p>

<p>
    By serving a second term on Senate, I will establish continuity in the impressive efforts that Student Senate Caucus has made this year.
    Specifically, my three goals for the upcoming Senate term are as follows:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        Chair Student Senate Caucus to develop a productive team dynamic and clear priorities with the incoming group of student Senators.
    </li>

    <li>
        Continue to serve as Chair of the Flexible Learning Ad-Hoc Committee, and prioritize working towards the establishment of a co-curricular transcript to provide official acknowledgement to student involvement outside of the classroom.
    </li>

    <li>
        Serve on the Senate Curriculum Committee working group on mental health and wellbeing to address curriculum issues that negatively impact student mental health, such as non-standardized workload expectations and the difficult-to-navigate Academic Calendar.
    </li>
</ol>
